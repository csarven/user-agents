# User Agents

The web fundamentally depends on user agents that help people access websites. We currently have a
technical definition in [Infra](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#user-agent), which drew on previous
definitions in [RFC2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-1.3),
[CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#user-agent),
[UAAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#def-user-agent), and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent.
We also have guidelines for user-agent behavior in the [Privacy
Principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/privacy-principles/#user-agents), even though they're not
primarily about privacy. This Draft Finding attempts to unify the W3C's and WHATWG's descriptions of
user agents in a single authoritative place.
